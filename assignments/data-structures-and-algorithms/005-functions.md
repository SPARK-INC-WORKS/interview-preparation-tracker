# Conditional Statements Problems


## Solve problems with functions

01. [x] Find the Largest of Three Numbers - Write a function that takes three integers as input and returns the largest of the three.
02. [x] Check for Leap Year - Write a function that checks whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400. (With return type, with argument)
03. [x] Generate Fibonacci Sequence - Write a function that takes an integer n and returns a list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. (Without return type, with argument)
04. [x] Find the GCD of Two Numbers - Write a function that takes two integers and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. (Without return type, with argument)
05. [x] Check if a Number is Palindrome - Write a function that takes an integer as input and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forward and backward). (Without return type, without argument)
16. [x] Calculator program - Write a program to perform +, -, *, / for the inputs 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Exit the program only if the user input is 'e'.
